Application to compare classifiers
Calculates average F measure for SVM and Decision Trees (information gain and GINI)
Plots data onto graphs
Compares the best measures from SVM and Decision Trees as well as LDA over the dataset and graphs final results comparing all classifiers (average class precision, average class recall and average class F-measure)
